## About

Kanban (from Japanese â€” "tag", "card", "sign") is a Japanese system of optimization and management of projects and production. It was invented and first introduced at Toyota factories in the early 1960s. Gradually, the advantages of the system were appreciated in other countries. Now it is used to manage projects around the world.
The basis of kanban is the use of special cards, which reflect all the information about the work process.
